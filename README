Cubit -- A Cube Pruning Decoder of Phrase-based Translation

described in Section 5.1 of:

Liang Huang and David Huang (2007). 
Forest Rescoring: Faster Decoding with Integrated Language Models.
In Proceedings of ACL, Prague, Czech Rep.

The related research was conducted at the University of Pennsylvania (Philadelphia, PA)
and the Information Sciences Institute, University of Southern California (Marina del Rey, CA).

Author: Liang Huang (lhuang3@cis.upenn.edu)

If you used or referred to this software for the implementation of cube pruning I request your citing of the above paper.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

To run Cubit you need the following packages:

1. Python >= 2.5
2. SRILM, a C++ toolkit of language modeling.
3. psrilm, a python port of SRILM by David Chiang (chiang@isi.edu)

and a Pharaoh-style phrase-table.

Main file: cubit.py

decoder.py:
	implements various decoding algorithms, which include:
		1) a faithful clone of Pharaoh-style forward update beam-search with per-bin threshold beams. 
			in function forward_search(lattice) 

		2) the backward-star version of 1), which provides the backbone of cube pruning.
			in function backward_search(lattice)

		3) (online version) of cube pruning. the core implementation has only 20 lines of code.
			in function online_cube(lattice)

	The code for the above three decoders are short and meant to be easily accessible.

	the search(lattice, ff=None) is the function which calls one of the above decoders. 
		ff is the "forced-decoding" option [for advanced debugging].

	also provides an important datastructure, class Bin, which is the collection of hypotheses 
		covering a same number of (translated) foreign words. Field "id" is the bin id, 
		e.g. bin #5 includes all hypotheses with 5 words translated. 
		There is some histogram and threshold pruning built-in (both borrowed from Pharaoh).
